          <h2>Total Arrivals in each State</h2>
          <p>
          Since 1991, tourism arrivals have grown dramatically across all Australian states and territories. 
          Every region now receives far more visitors than three decades ago. 
          <strong>Victoria</strong> shows the biggest jump with growth over <strong>540%</strong>, 
          followed by <strong>Western Australia</strong> (<strong>445%</strong>) and <strong>Tasmania</strong> (<strong>377%</strong>). 
          Even the slowest growth, in the <strong>Northern Territory</strong> (<strong>225%</strong>), means arrivals more than tripled. 
          Nationally, total arrivals have climbed from about <strong>884,000</strong> in 1991 to over <strong>21 million</strong> in 2025, roughly a fourfold increase. 
          This strong, consistent upward trend highlights how tourism has become a major part of Australia’s economy and identity.

          <h2>Who visit Australia the most?</h2>
          <p>
          The chart shows the <strong>top 15 countries by total arrivals</strong> to Australia. 
          <strong>New Zealand</strong> leads by a large margin, contributing nearly <strong>18.7%</strong> of all international visitors,
          almost one in five arrivals. The <strong>United Kingdom</strong> follows at <strong>12.2%</strong>, 
          reflecting strong historical and cultural ties. <strong>China</strong> (8.7%) and <strong>Japan</strong> (8.2%) are major Asian sources of visitors, 
          while the <strong>United States</strong> (7.2%) rounds out the top five. 
          Overall, the data highlights that Australia’s tourism is dominated by regional neighbours and English-speaking countries, 
          which shape Australia’s visitor base.

          <h2>Has tourism recover after Covid?</h2>
          <p>
          The chart shows how <strong>total visitor arrivals in Australia</strong> changed from <strong>2015 to 2025</strong>. 
          Visitor numbers were stable before 2020, averaging around <strong>1.5 to 2 million</strong> per month. 
          However, after <strong>COVID-19 restrictions began in March 2020</strong>, arrivals collapsed almost to zero — the sharpest drop in modern tourism history. 
          It took until <strong>late 2022</strong> for visitor numbers to begin a steady recovery, and by <strong>2024–2025</strong> arrivals had largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. 
          This pattern clearly highlights the severe but temporary impact of the pandemic on Australia’s tourism industry.

          <h2>Main reasons of short-term visitors</h2>
          <p>
          The chart shows how <strong>visitor arrivals by purpose</strong> changed from <strong>2015 onwards</strong>. 
          Before 2020, <strong>holidays</strong> and <strong>visiting friends or relatives</strong> were the most common reasons for travel. 
          When <strong>COVID-19 restrictions</strong> began, all categories dropped sharply, especially holiday travel, which nearly disappeared for almost two years. 
          Arrivals for <strong>education</strong> and <strong>employment</strong> also fell but started recovering earlier as borders reopened for students and workers. 
          By 2023–2025, most travel purposes had rebounded, though leisure travel remained below pre-pandemic highs. 
          This pattern highlights how different types of travel were affected and recovered at different speeds after the pandemic.

          <h2>When do most people visit Australia?</h2>
          <p>
          This chart compares <strong>monthly visitor patterns from 2015 to 2024</strong>, revealing clear seasonal trends in Australia’s tourism. 
          Visitor numbers peak sharply in the <strong>summer months of December, January, and February</strong>, 
          reflecting holiday travel and warm weather attractions. 
          Mid-year months such as <strong>May to September</strong> typically record fewer arrivals, forming the tourism off-season. 
          Despite year-to-year fluctuations, this recurring pattern shows that Australia’s tourism demand is strongly shaped by seasonal preferences, 
          with the top three months being <strong>December</strong>, <strong>January</strong>, and <strong>February</strong>.

          <h2>How long do short-term visitors stay in Australia?</h2>
          <p>
          This chart shows the <strong>share of visitors by length of stay in Australia</strong> from <strong>2015 to 2025</strong>. 
          Before 2020, most visitors stayed for <strong>less than one month</strong>, with short-term trips under <strong>two weeks</strong> making up the largest share. 
          During the <strong>COVID-19 period (2020–2021)</strong>, the pattern shifted dramatically — long stays of <strong>over six months</strong> suddenly became dominant, 
          as border closures limited short visits and only long-term visa holders or residents could remain in the country. 
          After 2022, short-term travel gradually recovered, and by 2024–2025 the visitor mix had largely returned to its pre-pandemic structure. 
          Overall, the data highlights how the pandemic temporarily reversed Australia’s usual pattern of short holiday stays.
